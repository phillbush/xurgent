XURGENT(1)                  General Commands Manual                 XURGENT(1)



NAME
       xurgent - set window urgency

SYNOPSIS
       xurgent [-eiu] wid

DESCRIPTION
       xurgent sets either the UrgencyHint flag on the WMHints property or the
       _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION state on the _NET_WM_STATE property of
       the window with the given window id (wid).  wid can be in decimal or in
       hex (if prefixed by 0x or 0X).  By default only the UrgencyHint on the
       WMHints property is set.

       The options are as follows:

       -e     Change the _NET_WM_STATE property (as specified by the EWMH).

       -i     Change the WMHints property (as specified by the ICCCM).

       -u     Unset urgency/attention rather then set it.

BUGS
       There are two semantically related states a window can have: it can
       be urgent or it can demands attention.  The urgency is set by the
       UrgencyHint in the WMHints property (as specified by ICCCM, the
       Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual).  The demand-attention
       state is set by the _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION in the
       _NET_WM_STATE property (as specified by EWMH, the Extended Window
       Manager Hints).  The semantic difference between a urgent window and a
       window that demands attention is not clear.

       The ICCCM says:

              The UrgencyHint flag, if set in the flags field, indicates that
              the client deems the window contents to be urgent, requiring the
              timely response of the user.  The window manager must make some
              effort to draw the user's attention to this window while this
              flag is set.  The window manager must also monitor the state of
              this flag for the entire time the window is in the Normal or
              Iconic state and must take appropriate action when the state of
              the flag changes.  The flag is otherwise independent of the
              window's state; in particular, the window manager is not
              required to deiconify the window if the client sets the flag on
              an Iconic window.  Clients must provide some means by which the
              user can cause the UrgencyHint flag to be set to zero or the
              window to be withdrawn.  The user's action can either mitigate
              the actual condition that made the window urgent, or it can
              merely shut off the alarm.

       The EWMH says:

              _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION indicates that some action in or
              with the window happened.  For example, it may be set by the
              Window Manager if the window requested activation but the Window
              Manager refused it, or the application may set it if it finished
              some work.  This state may be set by both the Client and the
              Window Manager.  It should be unset by the Window Manager when it
              decides the window got the required attention (usually, that it
              got activated).
